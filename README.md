3. **MongoDB Integration**: The integration of MongoDB, a versatile NoSQL database, ensures efficient storage and retrieval of student details.

4. **Express.js Framework**: The portal utilizes the Express.js framework, a robust and flexible web application framework, to build the server-side application.

5. **React Library**: The dynamic and responsive user interface is constructed using React, a powerful JavaScript library renowned for its efficient UI development capabilities.

6. **Node.js Runtime Environment**: The portal harnesses the Node.js runtime environment, enabling high-performance execution of server-side code and seamless scalability.

7. **Simplified Symptom Input**: Students can easily input their symptoms through a dedicated form, providing a streamlined process for describing their health concerns.

8. **Automated Doctor Assignment**: Leveraging the symptom information provided, the portal employs an intelligent algorithm to assign dedicated doctors, ensuring personalized care for each student.
